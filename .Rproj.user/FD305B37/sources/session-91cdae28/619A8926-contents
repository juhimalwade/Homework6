# Homework6

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

**Homework6** provides an S4 class implementation for sparse numeric vectors in R. Sparse vectors store only non-zero values and their positions. This makes them highly memory-efficient for vectors containing many zeros. Use cases for this class include text mining, machine learning, and scientific computing where data is predominantly sparse.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Homework6 from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("juhimalwade/Homework6")
```

## The sparse_numeric Class

The package implements an S4 class called `sparse_numeric` with three slots:

- **value**: A numeric vector containing only the non-zero values
- **pos**: An integer vector of indices indicating positions of non-zero values
- **length**: An integer representing the length of the vector, including non-zero and zero values.

## Core Functionality

### Creating Sparse Vectors

Sparse vectors can be created by coercing standard numeric vectors using the `as()` function. You can also construct sparse vectors directly using the `new()` function and input the values, positions, and length.

### Arithmetic Operations

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two sparse vectors
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts one sparse vector from another
- **Multiplication (\*)**: Performs element-wise multiplication

All operations maintain the sparse representation.

### Vector Operations

- **sparse_crossprod**: Computes the dot product between two sparse vectors by only multiplying overlapping non-zero elements
- **mean**: Calculates the mean considering the full vector length, which includes implicit zeros
- **norm**: Computes the Euclidean (L2) norm from stored non-zero values
- **standardize**: Scales the vector to have mean zero and unit variance

### Type Coercion

The package provides conversion between sparse and dense representations:

- Convert dense numeric vectors to sparse format with `as(vector, "sparse_numeric")`
- Convert sparse vectors back to dense format with `as.numeric(sparse_vector)`
- The `as.numeric()` method reconstructs the full vector with zeros in appropriate positions

### Visualization

The `plot()` method allows visual comparison of two sparse vectors. It displays the non-zero positions and values for both vectors on a single plot, using different colors to distinguish between them. This is useful for understanding the structure and overlap of sparse data.

### Display Methods

The `show()` method provides a clean display of sparse vectors, showing:

- The total length of the vector
- Positions that contain non-zero values
- The actual values at those positions
